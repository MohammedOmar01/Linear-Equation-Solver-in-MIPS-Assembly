# Linear-Equation-Solver-in-MIPS-Assembly
A MIPS assembly program that solves 2x2 and 3x3 linear systems using Cramerâ€™s Rule. It reads equations from a text file, supports multiple systems, validates input, and displays results on-screen or writes to a file based on user choice. Built for the MARS simulator with a looping user menu.
